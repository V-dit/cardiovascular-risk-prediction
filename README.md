Predicting the risk of Coronary Heart Disease from the data availalbe.\
This is a Capstone Project of Machine Learning (Classification Problem) undertaken as a course submission for the curricullum of [Full Stack Data Science](https://www.almabetter.com/courses/full-stack-data-science) with AlmaBetter.
A cardiovascular dataset was used to determine if a patient with certain demographics was under the risk of cardiovascular disease. The exercise is classified under supervised machine learning problems to be solved with classification methods. Python libraries like numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn (sklearn) were used. Concepts like SMOTE, MinMaxScaler, xgBoost, K-Neighbours classifier, Support Vector Machines, decision tree, random forest method, gridsearchcv and SHAP were used. The model performance was determined using parameters like accuracy score, precision score, recall score, f1 score, confusion matrix and roc_auc score.
